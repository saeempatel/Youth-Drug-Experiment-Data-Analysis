# Youth-Drug-Experiment-Data-Analysis
With this project, my goal was to explore the various reasons why teenagers are turning to drugs, and to understand the key influences that may be driving this behavior. The dataset I will be using for my analysis is titled "youth_smoking_drug_data_10000_rows_expanded.csv," which I found on Kaggle. Kaggle is a popular platform that offers free public datasets, making it an excellent resource for data analysis. What interested me about this particular dataset is that it contains data collected between 2020 and 2024, meaning the information I am working with is up-to-date and relevant to current trends in youth behaviour. Additionally, I chose this dataset because I personally know individuals who have experimented with drugs at a young age, and I am curious to understand the factors that may have contributed to their decisions. In my analysis, I have focused on three primary factors: media influence, family background, and peer pressure. I aim to examine the correlation between these factors and drug experimentation, to uncover potential reasons behind the growing normalization of drug use among teenagers today.
